My contribution of user stories:

User Story 1
	As a user (clinician), I want the game to be locked in when I hand it to the child, so they cannot access any settings or sensitive information in the app
User Story 2
	As a child using the application, I want the game to recognise when I am struggling and revert back to something I was more successful at so that I stay engaged and do not get frustrated. 

User Story 3
	As a child who has not yet learned to read using the application, I want the game to have many audio cues to make it as accessible to me as it is to anyone else.
